## USB Host Libraries

* [ESP32-USB-Soft-Host](https://github.com/tobozo/ESP32-USB-Soft-Host). The library supports up to four HID low-speed devices at the same time. While it is suitable for standard keyboards, it is not compatible with HID devices that are emulated by MCUs.

* [ESP USB Host](https://github.com/tanakamasayuki/EspUsbHost). Not yet tested.

* [USB Host](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/usbhost/). The library supports one boot keyboard. It seems reliable. Allows to enable a USB Host Co-Processor.

* [USB_Host_Library_SAMD](https://github.com/gdsports/USB_Host_Library_SAMD). Not yet tested.

* [Adafruit_TinyUSB_Arduino](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TinyUSB_Arduino). Not yet tested.
